        <div class="mt-5 prose prose-indigo text-gray-500">
          <h3>How We Calculate Payment </h3>
          <p>Each resource is billed for 32 hours/week multiplied by their hourly rate unless otherwise noted. Invoices are submitted monthly and denominated in USD.  </p>
          <p>The hourly rate is calculated based on the complexity of the tasks you assign to a billable resource.  </p>
          <p>Occasionally programs change. As schedules or task assignments change; we update your SoW to reflect these changes.  </p>
          <p>The updates may have financial implications based on the complexity of the program or schedule updates that necessitate frequent overtime compensation for the people assigned to the program.   </p>
          <h3>Payment Schedule & Reconciliation</h3>
          <p>We invoice in advance of services rendered. When there is a discrepancy between the hours invoiced and the hours worked, the discrepancy will be credited on the following invoice. </p>
          <h3>Overtime</h3>
          <p>When you require overtime beyond the scope of the SoW, you are obliged to pay for the overtime hours according to the following computation as mandated by the Philippines labor code:  </p>
